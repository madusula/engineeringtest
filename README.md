This branch contains files for the part 1 of task 1. :
1. Write a script that accepts a positive integer range and, for each increment in the range, prints:
   - "Fizz" if a multiple of 3
   - "Buzz" if a multiple of 5
   - The integer itself otherwise.
   
   E.g. for f[12..16], the output is "Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16".


All the unit tests for part one of task one is inside the folder tests in the project folder.

index.php is a webbased interfase created for running the script of task 1.1.
